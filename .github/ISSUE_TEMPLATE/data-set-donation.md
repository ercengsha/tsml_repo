**Please give a brief description of the data**

provide a link or ask us to contact you directly if that is better

A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

**Is your data multivariate or univariate?**

**Is there a default train/test split for the data**
If not, we will create one randomly. If this is inappropriate (e.g. want to avoid test subjects being in both train and test splits) let us know and advise on how we should split

**Are there any missing values/padding?**
We do not want to pre pad data. If the series are not equal length, please let us know

**Is there a picture for the data we can put on the website?**

**How would you like the donation attributed on the website?**

**Can you provide a paragraph description, including the meaning of the class values, for the website?**
