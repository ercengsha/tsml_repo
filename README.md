# Time Series Machine Learning Repository

This is a place to discuss the UCR and UEA time series classification archives hosted at http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/. If you want to donate data or have any problems with data in the archive, please raise an issue.

We will document all changes on the Wiki page, and update this repo with more info when we get time
